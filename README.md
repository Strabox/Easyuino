# Easyuino [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Strabox/Easyuino.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Strabox/Easyuino)

Easyuino is a library that offers a modular and set of APIs to several sensors and devices that connects to Arduino (e.g: Relays, RGB Leds, Ultrasonic Modules, GSM Modules, Water Detectors, ...). 

The Easyuino library has 5 fundamental goals:
1. Easy to integrate in your favorite IDEs because it works like a common Arduino library
2. Facilitate the use of several common sensors and devices by beginners but provide a useful API for a bit more advanced users
3. Use minimum code and memory footprint (due to controllers flash and sram memory constraints) while maintaining a simple API to extend and develop
4. Put all the sensors API under the same mental/use model to facilitate and speed up the users interest to get new sensors and devices that instigate learning of programming and electronics (Basically support the Arduino foundation ideas)
5. Having fun using Easyuino as much as I have developing it!!!

## Sensors and Devices Support

The development of the library, including fixes and addition of new sensors/devices, will be done depending on:
- My time availability (Now I am doing my Masters Degree Thesis in Computer Science and Engineering that stoles a good slice of my time)
- Interest of people in Easyuino

Important: Nevertheless I will accept suggestions for interesting devices/sensors to develop and if there are a lot of interest I will start prioritize them.

More Important: If you have any question about the library or some doubts about the supported devices you can contact me too !!!

## Getting Started

1. Use GitHub download *green* button to get the library as a .zip file
2. Using Arduino IDE got to to menu bar choose **Sketch > Include Library** and select the .zip file downloaded in 1.
3. *[Optional]* Look at https://github.com/Strabox/Easyuino/wiki to usage examples and details about the API
4. **[Not Optional]** Have fun!!!

## Easyuino History

I am Computer Scientist and Engineer (not an Electrotechnical one) that loves programming special in C/C++. 
This library started with a necessity to use several sensors in one personal project and at same time make me practice C/C++ programming and a bit o "low level" programming.
At certain point in the development of the project I decided that isolate all the interfaces with each sensor was a good idea and created this library to help others use the devices easily.
