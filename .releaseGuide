This guide has the steps/checklist to do in order to release a new Easyuino version.

Note: I Would like to automatize this (with batch scripts or a build tool JENKINS???)
but for now I will go like this while this doesn't take off the ground.

1. Update Keywords.txt and README.md IF there are new things or changes in the public API.
2. Update .travis.yml IF there are new things to add into CI (e.g: new examples files to build).
3. Update the Easyuino version to the new one in library.properties.
4. Update the Easyuino version to the new one in Doxyfile.
5. Run the Doxygen with Doxyfile to generate the documentation into the /docs folder.
6. Run the visual studio line endings plugin on the solution to put all the files with Unix style.
7. Commit (DON'T forget close github issues in the commit message if there are any).
8. Push/Sync to the remote branch.
9. Merge the remote branch with master branch IF travis build pass.
10. Create a new release (over the master branch) in GitHub in order to the Arduino Library crawler update the Easyuino entry.
--- RELEASE DONE!!
